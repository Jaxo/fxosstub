Nine months later, I had developed "Jaxogram", one of the first paid application
submitted to the Firefox Marketplace.&nbsp;
At this time, I had acquired a better knowledge of HTML 5 and CSS 3.&nbsp;
and the Firefox OS tools started to reach an outstanding quality level.
<p>Although I don't feel anymore a newbie, I'm still reticent at using
JQuery, Ajax, &hellip;.&nbsp;
I want to keep a pure ISO-blessed attitude.
</p><p>
One of the criterium in developing "Jaxogram" was to obtain an User Interface
as close as possible to the recommendations of the Firefox Designers, the
<i>Firefox OS Look'n Feel</i>.&nbsp;
I followed the <A href="http://buildingfirefoxos.com/">Building Firefox OS</a>
(BFFOS) guide, and added the "glue" between the blocks, to make them playing
in a more collaborative way.
</p><p>
In this chapter, I tried to make a synthesis of the techniques I applied,
and determine to my best key points or generalizations suited
for most FxOS applications.
