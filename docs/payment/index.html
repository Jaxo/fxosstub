Pre-paid App vs. In-App Payment
</div>
<p>
As indicated
<a href="https://marketplace.firefox.com/developers/docs/payments">
here,
</a>
Mozilla offers several payment models, particularly:
<ul><li>
<i>prepaid apps</i>, paid by the user at download time, and;
</li><li><i>in-app payments</i>, paid <i>on demand</i>,
after the user has downloaded the application.
</li></ul>
On
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Apps/Publishing/App_payments_testing">
this other page,
</a>
one can find all the relevant and detailed
documentation Mozilla provides regarding payment.&nbsp;
I'm willing to complete this technical information explaining it
from my developer point of view.
<h2><a href="prepaid.html">Pre-Paid App</a></h2>
<p><b><i>
you don't want to bother adding code for payment?
then just tell Mozilla your app is a "paid app".&nbsp;
</i></b>
Mozilla will take care of all the rest.
</p><p><u>What is the risk?</u>
<br/>The same as for counterfeit money.&nbsp;
Even if Firefox did its best for making your app installable only from
the Marketplace, you are never 100% sure.&nbsp;
1) the buyer may ask for an immediate refund; or,
2) a nasty hacker may use the manifest from your site.
<p>Checking that your paid-app has effectively been paid is not so
complex.&nbsp;
Jump to <a href="prepaid.html">Managing Pre-Paid App</a> for details,
and examples of working implementations.

<h2><a href="inapp.html">In-App Payment</a></h2>
<p>The process is more complicated, because it is your app that
originates the request from the user's mobile phone.&nbsp;
Encryption is required to insure the validity of the exchange,
avoiding most man-in-the-middle attacks.
<p>
Although <i>in-app</i> payment has several advantages:
your app could be installed for free so that your potential users
get some feed-back of what it is about.&nbsp;
Then you add optionals &mdash; paid &mdash; features "&agrave; la carte".&nbsp;
You could even foresee a mix of the two: a minimal fee to install the app,
and more to extend it.
</p><p>
In the section <a href="inapp.html">Processing In-app payment</a>,
I describe the process in details, with all source code attached in the hope
that it will make you implement "in-app" payment in just a couple of hours.
