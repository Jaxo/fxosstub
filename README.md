### A minimalist fxos application template

*fxosstub* is the most simplistic, minimalist pattern to get the most newbies
started building an application for Firefox OS on mobile, and it must stay
as such: no rings, no bells. The Ariadne's string through the Labyrinth,
just enough to wake up the enthusiasm of legions of developers.

*fxosstub* does absolutely nothing, except to show a screen suitable for
obtaining the familiar layout of a mobile application aujus Firefox:
a top header --with an install button, a body section, a bottom
toolbar --with normalized icons. In the body section, there is a
text area --launching the virtual keyboardy --and a progress bar.
All of this is supposed to self-adapt to an adequate size, keeping the
text readable, the buttons finger-reachable.

*fxosstub* fills the gap between (i) what you are used to for building a
regular web-page on a laptop/desktop display, and (ii) what is required
on mobile with touch screens of reduced size.
